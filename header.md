## Overview

Each LIFX Protocol message has the following format ...

| Frame | Frame Address | Protocol header | Payload |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|---------|

The header is composed of the Frame, Frame Address and Protocol header.
The Payload is covered separately in the documentation for the various
message types.

## Frame

The Frame section contains information about the ...

* Size of the entire message
* LIFX Protocol number: must be 1024 (decimal)
* Use of the Frame Address _target_ field
* Source identifier

![](header/frame.png)

| Field | Bits | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| size | 16 | uint16_t | Size of entire message in bytes including this field |
| origin | 2 | uint8_t | Message origin indicator: must be zero (0) |
| tagged | 1 | bool | Determines usage of Frame Address _target_ field
| addressable | 1 | bool | Message includes a target address: must be one (1) |
| protocol | 12 | uint16_t | Protocol number: must be 1024 (decimal) |
| source | 32 | uint32_t | Source identifier: unique value set by the client, used by responses |

The _tagged_ field is a boolean flag that indicates whether the Frame Address
_target_ field is being used to address an individual device or all devices.
For device discovery using
[Device::GetService](messages/device.md#getservice---2),
the _tagged_ field should be set to one (1) and the _target_ should be all
zeroes.  In all other messages, the _tagged_ field should be set to zero (0)
and the _target_ field should contain the device MAC address.

The _source_ identifier allows each client to provide an unique value,
which will be included by the LIFX device in any message that is sent in
response to a message sent by the client.
If the _source_ identifier is a non-zero value, then the LIFX device will
send a unicast message to the source IP address and port that the client
used to send the originating message.
If the _source_ identifier is a zero value, then the LIFX device may send
a broadcast message that can be received by all clients on the same sub-net.
See _ack\_required_ and _res\_required_ fields in the Frame Address.

## Frame Address

The Frame Address section contains routing information about the ...

* Target device address
* Acknowledgement message is required flag
* State response message is required flag
* Message sequence number

![](header/frame_address.png)

| Field | Bits | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| target | 64 | uint64_t | 6 byte device address (MAC address) or zero (0) means all devices |
| reserved | 48 | uint8_t[6] | Must all be zero (0) |
| reserved | 6 | | Reserved |
| ack_required | 1 | bool | Acknowledgement message required |
| res_required | 1 | bool | Response message required |
| sequence | 8 | uint8_t | Wrap around message sequence number |

The _target_ device address is 8 bytes long, when using the 6 byte MAC address
then left-justify the value and zero-fill the last two bytes.
A _target_ device address of all zeroes effectively addresses all devices
on the local network.  The Frame _tagged_ field must be set accordingly.

There are two flags that cause a LIFX device to send a message in response.
In these cases, the _source_ identifier in the response message will be set
to the same value as that in the requesting message sent by the client.

* _ack\_required_ set to one (1) will cause the device to send an
[Device::Acknowledgement](messages/device.md#acknowledgement---45) message
* _res\_required_ set to one (1) within a Set message,
e.g [Light::SetPower](messages/light.md#setpower---117)
will cause the device to send the corresponding State message,
e.g [Light::StatePower](messages/light.md#statepower---118)

The client can use acknowledgements to determine that the LIFX device
has received a message.  However, when using acknowledgements to ensure
reliability in an over-burdened lossy network ... causing additional
network packets may make the problem worse.

Client that don't need to track the updated state of a LIFX device can
choose not to request a response, which will reduce the network burden
and may provide some performance advantage.  In some cases, a device
may choose to send a state update response independent of whether
_res\_required_ is set.

The _sequence_ number allows the client to provide a unique value,
which will be included by the LIFX device in any message that is sent in
response to a message sent by the client.
This allows the client to distinguish between different messages sent with
the same _source_ identifier in the Frame.
See _ack\_required_ and _res\_required_ fields in the Frame Address.

## Protocol header

The Protocol header contains information about the message ...

* Message type which determines what action to take (based on the Payload)

![](header/protocol.png)

| Field | Bits | Type | Description |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| reerved | 64 | uint64_t | Reserved |
| type | 16 | uint16_t | Message type determines the payload being used |
| reserved | 16 | | Reserved |

Reserved fields must be set to zero by the client..

## C header declaration

```c
#pragma pack(push, 1)
typedef struct {
  /* frame */
  uint16_t size;
  uint16_t protocol:12;
  uint8_t  addressable:1;
  uint8_t  :1;
  uint8_t  origin:2;
  uint32_t source;
  /* frame address */
  uint8_t  target[8];
  uint8_t  reserved[6];
  uint8_t  res_required:1;
  uint8_t  ack_required:1;
  uint8_t  :6;
  uint8_t  sequence;
  /* protocol header */
  uint64_t :64;
  uint16_t type;
  uint16_t :16;
  /* variable length payload follows */
} lx_protocol_header_t;
#pragma pack(pop)
```

Numeric data-type byte-order is
[little-endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian),
which means that dumping serialized data structures or viewing network
packet sniffing may show the content of numeric fields in reversed
byte-order.
