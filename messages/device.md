## Overview

Device messages control and acquire the state of a device,
independent of its specific type.  The state is composed of the
[label](#label), [port](#port), [power level](#power-level), [time](#time),
firmware version and microcontroller statistics.

These messages are common to all LIFX devices, which may also implement
device specific messages, such as [light messages](light.md).

The [Protocol header](../header.md#protocol-header) _message type_ field value
(decimal) appears after each message name in this document.
Each section below describes the _payload_ that is appended to the
[message header](../header.md).  Some messages do not require a payload.

## Enumerated types

### Service

Describes the services exposed by the device.

| Type | Value |
|-----|------|
| UDP | 1 |
| reserved | 2 |
| reserved | 3 |
| reserved | 4 |

When a device is [discovered](../workflows.md#discovery) the Service types
and IP [port](#port) are provided.

The LIFX Protocol utilizes UDP/IP for all messages covered by this
documentation.

## Message field data types

### Label

For user interfaces purposes, each device can be identified by their _label_.

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| label | string, size: 32 bytes |

The _label_ string is a fixed-length field, which is __not__ null-terminated.

### Port

The IP port number used by a LIFX device for a specific [Service](#service).

| Field | Type |
|-----|------|
| port | unsigned 32-bit integer |

Whilst LIFX devices usually listen to port 56700, it is strongly recommended
that devices are discovered and the provided port number is used.

As of LIFX Protocol V2, LIFX devices sending unicast message responses will
reply to whichever port number the client has bound.
See [message header frame source identifier](../header.md#frame)
regarding the conditions under which unicast messages are sent.

Prior to LIFX Protocol V2, i.e the Original LIFX A21 lightbulb running
firmware version 1.x, LIFX devices send broadcast message responses to
port 56700.

To get the best compatibility across both newer and older LIFX devices,
clients should bind to UDP port 56700.

### Power level

The _power level_ can be either standby (0) or enabled (65535).

| Field | Type |
|-------|------|
| level | unsigned 16-bit integer |

Currently, only the values 0 and 65535 are supported

### Time

All _time_ values have a precision of nanoseconds.
When an absolute time value is provided, then it is the number of
nanoseconds since the [epoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time),
i.e Thursday 1st January 1970 00:00:00.

| Field | Type |
|-----|------|
| time | unsigned 64-bit integer |
